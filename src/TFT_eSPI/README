This is a copy of a library file that is part of TFT_eSPI. It is stored in the repository
here, so that changes to it can be tracked. It must be copied into the library for it to 
be used by the libary though.

So, simply copy User_Setup.h to your TFT_eSPI library, i.e., starting from this folder,

cp User_Setup.h ../../.pio/libdeps/esp32dev/TFT_eSPI/User_Setup.h
